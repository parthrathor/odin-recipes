    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Paneer Butter Masala is one of India's most popular paneer gravy recipes, and with good reason! Indian cottage cheese cubes are smothered in a creamy, lightly spiced tomato sauce that is downright delicious.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Ripe, red & juicy tomatoes</li>
        <li>Raw Cashews</li>
        <li>Cream</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Paneer</li>
        <li>Spices & Herbs</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps To Make</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Soak 18 to 20 cashews in â…“ cup hot water for 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>While the cashews are soaking, you can prep the other ingredients. It's time for chopping tomatoes, chopping and preparing the ginger-garlic paste, and slicing paneer into cubes.</li>
        <li>To make the ginger garlic paste, crush a 1 inch piece of peeled ginger with 3 to 4 small to medium-sized garlic cloves in a mortar & pestle. Continue crushing until it is a semi-fine or fine paste. Keep aside.</li>
        <li>
            After 20 to 30 minutes, drain the water and add the soaked cashews to a blender or mixer-grinder.
            Also, add 2 to 3 tablespoons fresh water (or as much as is required to blend to a fine paste).
        </li>
        <li>Blend to a smooth paste without any tiny bits or chunks of cashews. Remove the cashew paste from the blender and set it aside.</li>
    
    </ol>
